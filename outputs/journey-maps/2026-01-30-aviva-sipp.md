# Customer Journey Map: Aviva SIPP

**Generated:** 2026-01-30
**Research Method:** Public information analysis (website, app stores, review sites, comparison platforms)

---

## Executive Summary

Aviva positions its SIPP as an accessible, flexible retirement savings product targeting both consolidators (people with multiple old pensions) and new savers. Their value proposition centers on simplicity, competitive fees (0.35% platform charge), and breadth of choice (5,000+ funds). The journey is designed to funnel users toward "ready-made" investment options while offering self-select for experienced investors.

**Key Strengths:** Strong brand trust (6 million pension customers), competitive pricing, good digital tools (website and app), clear investment tiering from simple to complex, and attractive transfer incentives (up to £2,500 gift card).

**Critical Friction Points:** Customer service is the Achilles heel. Reviews consistently cite slow administrative processing (weeks for simple tasks), long phone wait times (1+ hours reported), difficulties withdrawing funds, and poor complaint resolution. The gap between their polished digital front-end and their back-office operations is significant.

**Strategic Insight:** Aviva has invested heavily in acquisition (marketing, transfer bonuses, slick onboarding) but appears under-invested in service delivery. This creates opportunity for competitors who can match their digital polish while delivering responsive customer service.

## Competitive Implications

**What this means for your platform:**

1. **Don't compete on price alone:** Aviva's 0.35% is competitive. Differentiate on service.

2. **Service is the gap:** Aviva has invested in acquisition but not service delivery. A platform that matches their digital polish while delivering responsive, knowledgeable support has a significant advantage.

3. **Simplify investment choice:** Aviva's four-tier system creates cognitive load. A cleaner "choose your comfort level" approach with fewer options may convert better.

4. **Make money accessible:** The reported difficulties withdrawing funds and slow processing create anxiety. Position around "your money, when you need it."

5. **Proactive > Reactive:** Aviva's support is reactive and slow. Proactive check-ins, progress updates, and anticipatory service would differentiate.

6. **Transfer experience matters:** The 3-6 week transfer wait is an opportunity. Better progress tracking, proactive updates, and "we'll handle everything" messaging during this anxious period builds trust.

7. **Target their dissatisfied customers:** Aviva's Trustpilot reviews reveal frustrated customers actively looking to leave. "Switching to us is easy" messaging could capture this segment.
