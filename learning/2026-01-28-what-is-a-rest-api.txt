WHAT IS A REST API?
==================

A learning note for design leaders exploring technical concepts


WHAT IT IS (SIMPLE TERMS)
-------------------------

Think of a REST API as a waiter in a restaurant.

You (the customer) don't go into the kitchen to make your food. Instead, you tell the waiter what you want, and the waiter brings it back to you. The waiter is the middleman who knows how to communicate with the kitchen.

A REST API works the same way between software systems:
- Your application (the customer) needs data or wants to perform an action
- The API (the waiter) takes that request to another system (the kitchen)
- The API returns the result back to your application

REST stands for "Representational State Transfer" - but you don't need to memorize that. What matters is understanding that it's a standardized way for software to talk to other software over the internet.

Key characteristics:
- Uses simple web addresses (URLs) to identify resources
- Uses standard actions: GET (read), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (remove)
- Returns data in formats like JSON (structured text that looks like organized lists)


WHY IT MATTERS FOR DESIGN AUTOMATION
------------------------------------

In financial services design automation, REST APIs are the connective tissue between your tools and systems:

1. CONNECTING YOUR DESIGN TOOLS
   Figma, design systems, and asset libraries all expose REST APIs. This means
   you can programmatically pull designs, check for updates, or push assets
   without manual downloads and uploads.

2. INTEGRATING WITH COMPLIANCE SYSTEMS
   Financial services require audit trails and approvals. APIs let your design
   workflows automatically log changes, request sign-offs, and verify that
   assets meet regulatory requirements.

3. AUTOMATING HANDOFFS
   Instead of manually exporting and sending files, an API can automatically
   deliver approved designs to development teams, content management systems,
   or marketing platforms.

4. REAL-TIME DATA IN PROTOTYPES
   Want to show actual (anonymized) portfolio data in a prototype? APIs make
   it possible to pull live information into design mockups.


A CONCRETE EXAMPLE
------------------

Scenario: Automating brand asset distribution

Your team updates the brand color palette. In a manual world:
- Designer updates colors in the design system
- Someone exports updated assets
- Files get emailed or uploaded to various teams
- Developers manually update their codebases
- Inconsistencies creep in

With REST APIs:
- Designer updates colors in Figma
- An automated script calls Figma's REST API to detect the change
- The script calls your internal design system API to update color tokens
- Another API call notifies the development team's system
- Code repositories automatically receive pull requests with updates

The API call might look conceptually like this:

  GET https://api.figma.com/v1/files/{file-id}/styles

  Returns: List of all colors, fonts, and effects in the file

  POST https://internal-design-system.yourbank.com/tokens/colors
  Body: { "primary-blue": "#0052CC", "updated-by": "automation" }

No manual file transfers. No version confusion. Changes propagate in minutes, not days.


WHAT TO EXPLORE NEXT
--------------------

1. LOOK AT FIGMA'S API DOCUMENTATION
   https://www.figma.com/developers/api
   See what's possible with design tool APIs specifically.

2. LEARN ABOUT WEBHOOKS
   These are "reverse APIs" - instead of you asking for data, systems notify
   you when something changes. Powerful for triggering automated workflows.

3. UNDERSTAND AUTHENTICATION
   APIs need to know who's calling them. Learn about API keys and OAuth -
   these are how systems verify identity and permissions.

4. EXPLORE NO-CODE API TOOLS
   Tools like Zapier, Make (formerly Integromat), or Postman let you
   experiment with APIs without writing code. Great for prototyping workflows.

5. ASK YOUR DEVELOPMENT TEAM
   What internal APIs already exist at your organization? You might be
   surprised what's already available to connect to.


KEY VOCABULARY
--------------

Endpoint    - A specific URL where an API can be reached
Request     - What you send to an API (asking for something)
Response    - What the API sends back
JSON        - A common data format APIs use (looks like nested lists)
HTTP        - The protocol APIs use to communicate (same as web browsers)
Status code - A number indicating success (200) or error (404, 500, etc.)


REMEMBER
--------

You don't need to write API code yourself. Your role is to:
- Understand what APIs make possible
- Identify opportunities for automation in your workflows
- Communicate effectively with developers about what you want to achieve
- Ask the right questions: "Does this system have an API? What can it do?"

APIs are the building blocks of modern automation. Once you see them, you'll
notice opportunities everywhere.
